# Chip-for-SARS-CoV-2

In this project, we present a new technology based on tiling array that can re-sequence the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome and with the capability of identifying mutations. 

Tiling array is a type of microarray technology. 

- Input:

core0_annot_mod.tsv  # Annotation file

heatmap.csv  # Tiling array file


- Output:

The sequence and score.
